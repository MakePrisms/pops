//! Mint client abstraction used by the verify core.
//!
//! [`CashuCredential`][crate::cashu_credential::CashuCredential] confirms a
//! token's structural fit against a
//! [`CashuRequirement`][crate::challenge::CashuRequirement] locally, then
//! calls the issuing mint to perform an atomic swap. A successful swap proves
//! the proofs are unexpired (mint enforces `final_expiry`) and unspent (mint
//! enforces nullifier replay protection), and yields new proofs under the
//! verifier's secrets — the charge is transfer-on-use.
//!
//! This module exposes only the trait + error surface. A concrete
//! `cdk`-backed implementation lives in [`crate::cdk_mint_client`] (native
//! only); tests in this crate use a mock impl defined alongside the
//! `cashu_credential` tests.
//!
//! The trait deliberately takes a [`MintUrl`] and [`Proofs`] rather than the
//! decoded [`Token`][cashu::Token] so concrete implementations can fetch
//! mint keyset info up front and feed already-expanded proofs to the swap
//! call. Translating a [`Token`][cashu::Token] into [`Proofs`] is the
//! validator's responsibility — and is why [`MintClient::keysets`] exists
//! as its own trait method: V1-format token keyset IDs are short (7 bytes)
//! and need a full [`KeySetInfo`] list to resolve into a long [`Id`][cashu::nuts::Id]
//! before [`Token::proofs`][cashu::Token::proofs] will return them.
//!
//! `MintClientError` is intentionally coarse: `Unreachable` for transport
//! failures and `RejectedSwap` for any mint-side refusal. It does not
//! distinguish expired vs. double-spent vs. keyset-rotated refusals. The one
//! exception is `SwapOutputDleqInvalid`, kept as its OWN arm (never folded into
//! `RejectedSwap`) because a swap whose returned blind signatures fail DLEQ is
//! a money-safety event — the mint handed back outputs we MUST NOT treat as
//! redeemed value — and the cross-slice contract surfaces it as the distinct
//! `ChargeError::DleqInvalid { location: SwapOutput }`, not a double-spend.
//!
//! On `wasm32` the trait is `#[async_trait(?Send)]` (single-threaded; matches
//! cdk's own wasm32 usage). On native it is `Send + Sync` so the validator can
//! be shared across async tasks (e.g. inside an HTTP handler chain).
